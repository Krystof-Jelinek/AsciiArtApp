Everything should work as it is described on courses with some specifications:

Added command : "--table-non-linear" which then makes the application use the non linear transformation

If user inputs some incorrect command he is usually notified with error message

with command : "--table "name" " there are 5 predifined tables named "0", "1", "2", "3" and "4"
